            This is a link to Climate Project with MCI <br>
            The solutions to climate change can't come at the expense of people's livelihoods. We need alternatives, not
            just
            bans, that empower communities to thrive in a green future. Indigenous knowledge holds valuable solutions
            for
            living
            in harmony with nature. We can't ignore this wisdom in the fight for climate justice
